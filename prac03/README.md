### 1. The number of child processes after 'n' folk():
- General Rule: If you have 'n' fork() calls, the total number of processes (including the original parent) is 2^n. So the number of child processes is (2^n - 1):
    - 1 fork: Produces 1 child process, 2 processes in total.
    - 2 forks: Produces 3 child processes, 4 processes in total.
    - 3 forks: Produces 7 child processes, 8 processes in total.
    - ...
    - n forks: Produces (2^n âˆ’ 1) child processes, 2^n processes in total.

- Why: Each fork() call doubles the number of processes because every existing process (parent and children) will execute the fork() and create a new child process.


### 2. The value of fd:
- The value of fd is an array of two integers that represent the file descriptors for the pipe. When you create a pipe using the pipe(fd); function call, the operating system assigns two file descriptors:
    - fd[0]: This is the file descriptor for the read end of the pipe.
    - fd[1]: This is the file descriptor for the write end of the pipe.
- The exact integer values assigned to fd[0] and fd[1] depend on the state of the file descriptor table at the time pipe(fd) is called. Typically, they are the lowest available file descriptors not currently in use by the process.

- In typical scenarios, the file descriptors '0', '1', and '2' are reserved for standard input, standard output, and standard error, respectively:
    - '0' is 'stdin' (standard input)
    - '1' is 'stdout' (standard output)
    - '2' is 'stderr' (standard error)
- For example:
    - If the lowest available file descriptor is 3, fd[0] might be '3', and fd[1] might be '4'.
    - If you closed some file descriptors before creating the pipe, those freed-up values could be assigned to fd[0] and fd[1].

### 3. pinGen.c in Task 3:
- You may want to try this:
```
if (pid > 0)
{
	close(fd[1]);       //close the write end of the pipe, parent reads only
	close(0);           //Close the standard input (stdin) file descriptor.
	dup(fd[0]);         //Duplicates the file descriptor fd[0] (read end of the pipe) into the lowest available file descriptor
	//This effectively redirects the standard input to read from the pipe.
...
}
```
